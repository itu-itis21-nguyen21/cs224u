There are many options. The only rule:\n\n__You cannot make any use of the test sets for DynaSent-R1, DynaSent-R2, or SST-3, at any time during the course of development.__\n\nThe integrity of the bakeoff depends on this rule being followed.\n\nIt's fine to use the dev sets for system development – indeed, we encourage this.\n\nFor system development, here are some relatively manageable ideas that you might try:\n\n* Different pretrained models. There are many models available on the [Hugging Face models hub](https://huggingface.co/models) that will be drop-in replacements for BERT-mini as we used it above.\n\n* Different fine-tuning regimes. We used the [CLS] token above. This doesn't make especially good use of the output states of the models. Pooling across these representtions (with sum, average, etc.) is likely to be better.\n\n* Different training regimes. You have three train sets at your disposal, and there may be other sentiment datasets that could contribute to making your system more robust in new domains.\n\n* Entirely different approaches. There is no requirement that you make use of any of the concepts from the homework questions in constructing your original system. Anything goes as long as you follow the one rule given above in bold.\n\nWe want to emphasize that this needs to be an original system. It doesn't suffice to download code from the Web, retrain, and submit. You can build on others' code, but you have to do something new and meaningful with it. See the course website for additional guidance on how original systems will be evaluated.\n\nIn the cell below, please provide a brief technical description of your original system, so that the teaching team can gain an understanding of what it does. This will help us to understand your code and analyze all the submissions to identify patterns and strategies.","block_group":"4c76b76f66b04a54a95b208a6c116476"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"aa9ecadcdf064b7c9d04a8d8c1ed03cb","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"# PLEASE MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING BETWEEN THE START AND STOP COMMENTS:\n#   1) Textual description of your system.\n#   2) The code for your original system.\n# PLEASE MAKE SURE NOT TO DELETE OR EDIT THE START AND STOP COMMENTS\n\n# START COMMENT: Enter your system description in this cell.\n\n\n# STOP COMMENT: Please do not remove this comment.","block_group":"56b135b728ed4ca4934bda6117d23013","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"bf6f7146815642c591dc1184c3461d20","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"## Question 4: Bakeoff entry [1 point]","block_group":"58241972a15c4a76b8f8c0cfbf6e8c42"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"48864526fdf54ceab918d684dad48e83","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"The bakeoff dataset is available at \n\nhttps://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/data/cs224u-sentiment-test-unlabeled.csv\n\nThis code should grab it for you and put it in `data/sentiment` if you are working in the cloud:","block_group":"ff2811e2841c41f6b2826228c27a2e9b"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"bc08af83052b4513987cda0487a0beb6","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"import os\n\nif not os.path.exists(os.path.join(\"data\", \"sentiment\", \"cs224u-sentiment-test-unlabeled.csv\")):\n    !mkdir -p data/sentiment\n    !wget https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224u/data/cs224u-sentiment-test-unlabeled.csv -P data/sentiment/","block_group":"28a6218538bb49fc91e803f58291cba0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"faa4649609264af4961cefc1b6a1e9a3","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"If the above fails, you can just download the file and place it in `data/sentiment`.","block_group":"d034d1ce0bbc4baaa3f0d43ca1627f68"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"fc9f9d53d71d4ae4bf3cdba499f4c65b","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"Once you have the file, you can load it to a `pd.DataFrame`:","block_group":"fa9ba7ff0e394a728e4e36e736cc7536"},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"60a79fe8346b47c1ae5f01758cfcccfe","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"bakeoff_df = pd.read_csv(\n    os.path.join(\"data\", \"sentiment\", \"cs224u-sentiment-test-unlabeled.csv\"))","block_group":"7fb4798dbe7942b38c2811f33a74fcc2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"source_hash":null,"deepnote_to_be_reexecuted":true,"cell_id":"10052dc0c3db4a3abf3885761efa2847","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"bakeoff_df.head()","block_group":"2f7fa3b8f05b45f0b48d8f16c230a029","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"efe6b2c75448409691c86c1b89c3f1b5","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":"To enter the bakeoff, you simply need to use your original system to:\n\n1.
